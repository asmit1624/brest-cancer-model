This project leverages the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to build a supervised machine learning model capable of classifying tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The model is trained using a variety of tumor features — such as radius, texture, area, and smoothness — to predict the diagnosis with high accuracy.

Using the Random Forest Classifier, the project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early cancer detection, aiding healthcare professionals in diagnostic decision-making.
